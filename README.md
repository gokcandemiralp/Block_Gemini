# query_appender_beta

This extension lets you customize your Google searches by adding a specific word or phrase after your search terms.

It's perfect for adding a phrase after your every regular google search.

For example if you add website names like Reddit or Stack Overflow you would get the context you prefer immediately.

Use the popup to set the word or phrase you want appended to your searches and click the "Change word" button to save.

When you do a regular google search on google.com or through the adress bar this term will be added automatically.
